1.Constant Folding
Constant folding is a technique used by compilers to evaluate constant expressions at compile-time rather than at runtime.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5 + 3;
In this case, the compiler can evaluate the expression 5 + 3 at compile-time and replace
it with the result, which is 8. So, the generated code would be equivalent to:
int x = 8;
This technique is called constant folding.


2.Constant Propagation
Constant propagation is a technique used by compilers to replace variables with constants if the variable is assigned a constant
value and is not reassigned.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x + 3;
In this case, the compiler can replace x with 5 in the second statement, resulting in:
int y = 5 + 3;
The compiler can then apply constant folding to evaluate the expression 5 + 3, resulting in:
int y = 8;
This technique is called constant propagation.


3.Copy Propagation
Copy propagation is a technique used by compilers to replace a variable with a copy of another variable if the
variable is assigned the value of another variable and is not reassigned.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x;
int z = y + 3;
In this case, the compiler can replace y with x in the third statement, resulting in:
int z = x + 3;
This technique is called copy propagation.


4 Dead Code Elimination
Dead code elimination is a technique used by compilers to remove code that is unreachable or has no effect on
the program's output.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
if (false) {
    x = 10;
    }
In this case, the code inside the if statement is unreachable because the condition is always false. The
compiler can eliminate this code, resulting in:
int x = 5;
This technique is called dead code elimination.


5.Peephole Optimization
Peephole optimization is a technique used by compilers to analyze and optimize a small section of code,
usually a few instructions, to improve performance.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
x = x + 1;
x = x + 1;
In this case, the compiler can optimize the code by combining the two increments into a single increment,
resulting in:
int x = 5;
x = x + 2;  
This technique is called peephole optimization.


6.Register Allocation
Register allocation is a technique used by compilers to assign variables to registers, which are small amounts of
fast memory built into the CPU.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x + 3;
In this case, the compiler can allocate the variable x to a register, say R1, and
the variable y to another register, say R2, resulting in:
R1 = 5;
R2 = R1 + 3;
This technique is called register allocation.


7.Instruction Selection
Instruction selection is a technique used by compilers to select the most efficient machine instructions to
implement a particular operation.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x * 2;
In this case, the compiler can select the most efficient machine instruction to implement the multiplication,
such as a shift instruction, resulting in:
R1 = 5;
R2 = R1 << 1;
This technique is called instruction selection.


8.Strength Reduction
Strength reduction is a technique used by compilers to replace expensive operations with cheaper ones.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x * 2;
In this case, the compiler can replace the multiplication with a shift operation, which is cheaper,
resulting in:
R1 = 5;
R2 = R1 << 1;
This technique is called strength reduction.

9.Simplifying Arithematic expressions
Simplifying arithmetic expressions is a technique used by compilers to simplify complex arithmetic
expressions into simpler ones.
For example, consider the following code:
int x = 5;
int y = x + 0;
In this case, the compiler can simplify the expression x + 0 to x, resulting in:
R1 = 5;
R2 = R1;
This technique is called simplifying arithmetic expressions.


10. Loop Optimization
Loop optimization is a technique used by compilers to optimize loops to reduce the number of iterations
or to reduce the number of operations performed inside the loop.
For example, consider the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = x + 1;
    }
In this case, the compiler can optimize the loop by reducing the number of iterations or by reducing the
number of operations performed inside the loop, resulting in:
R1 = 10;
R2 = R1 + 10;
This technique is called loop optimization.


11. Loop Unrolling
Loop unrolling is a technique used by compilers to increase the performance of loops by reducing the
number of iterations.
For example, consider the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = x + 1;
    }
In this case, the compiler can unroll the loop by increasing the number of operations performed inside
the loop, resulting in:
R1 = 0;
R2 = R1 + 1;
R3 = R2 + 1;
R4 = R3 + 1;
R5 = R4 + 1;
R6 = R5 + 1;
R7 = R6 + 1;
R8 = R7 + 1;
R9 = R8 + 1;
R10 = R9 + 1;
This technique is called loop unrolling.

12.Loop Fusion
Loop fusion is a technique used by compilers to combine two or more loops into a single loop to
reduce the number of iterations.
For example, consider the following code:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = x + 1;
    }

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    y = y + 1;
    }

In this case, the compiler can fuse the two loops into a single loop, resulting in:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = x + 1;
    y = y + 1;
    }

This technique is called loop fusion.

13.Loop Interchange
Loop interchange is a technique used by compilers to interchange the order of two nested loops to
improve performance.
For example, consider the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        x = x + 1;
        }
    }

In this case, the compiler can interchange the order of the two loops, resulting in:
for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        x = x + 1;
        }
    }

This technique is called loop interchange.

14.Loop Invariant Code Motion
Loop invariant code motion is a technique used by compilers to move code that does not depend on
the loop variables out of the loop.

For example, consider the following code:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x = x + y;
    }
    In this case, the compiler can move the code `x = x + y` out of the
    loop, resulting in:

x = x + y;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // empty loop
    }
This technique is called loop invariant code motion.

15. Loop Blocking   (tilin)
Loop blocking is a technique used by compilers to divide a large loop into smaller blocks, called
tiles, to improve performance.
For example, consider the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    x = x + 1;
    }

In this case, the compiler can divide the loop into smaller blocks of size 10, resulting
in:
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        x = x + 1;
        }
}
This technique is called loop blocking.
